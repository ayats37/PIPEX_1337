Pipex
ðŸ“Œ Overview
Pipex is a project that replicates the behavior of Unix pipelines (|) using C and system calls. It takes an input file, processes it through multiple commands, and writes the output to a specified file, just like Unix pipelines in a shell.

This project is part of the 42 School curriculum, focusing on process creation, file descriptor manipulation, and inter-process communication.
